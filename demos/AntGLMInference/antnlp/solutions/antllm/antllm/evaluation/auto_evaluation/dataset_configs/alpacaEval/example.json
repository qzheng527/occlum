    "instruction": "Hi, my sister and her girlfriends want me to play kickball with them. Can you explain how the game is played, so they don't take advantage of me?",
    "text-davinci-003": "Sure, kickball is a game similar to baseball, except that a large rubber ball is used instead of a bat and ball. Each team is made up of 10 players and the goal is to score more points than your opponent. The game is played on a diamond-shaped field, with bases at each corner. The pitcher stands in the center of the diamond and throws the ball to the kicker, who then kicks it as far as possible. The kicker and his/her teammates run around the bases, trying to score before the other team can get them out.",
    "0731_rlhf_600": "Sure, I can explain how kickball is played. Kickball is a team sport played on a field with a goal at each end. The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.\n\nThe game is played with two halves, each consisting of four quarters. In each quarter, the team with the ball has one minute to score as many points as possible. The team with the most points at the end of the quarter wins the quarter.\n\nThe game is played with a soccer ball, which is kicked with the foot. The player with the ball must pass it to the player on their team's goal line, who must then kick it into the goal. If the ball is kicked into the goal, the team scores a point. If the ball is kicked into the goal by an opponent, the team loses a point.\n\nIt's important to remember that kickball is a team sport, and it's important to work as a team to score as many points as possible. It's also important to be respectful of your opponents and to play the game with sportsmanship."
