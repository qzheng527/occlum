It is sung in the musical by the character Freddy Eynsford-Hill, who was portrayed by John Michael King in the original production. In the 1964 film version, it was sung by Bill Shirley, dubbing for actor Jeremy Brett.\nThe most popular single of the song was recorded by Vic Damone in 1956 for Columbia Records. It reached #4 on the Billboard magazine charts and #6 on Cash Box magazine's chart. It was a #1 hit in the UK in 1958.\nIn 1955, Damone had only one song on the charts, \"Por Favor,\" which did not make it above #73. However, he did have major roles in two movie musicals, Hit the Deck and Kismet. In early 1956, he moved from Mercury to Columbia Records and had some success on that label with hits like \"On the Street Where You Live\" (from My Fair Lady, his final pop top ten) and \"An Affair to Remember\" (from the movie of the same name). His six original, long-playing albums on Columbia between 1957 and 1961 were That Towering Feeling, Angela Mia, Closer Than a Kiss, This Game of Love, On the Swingin' Side and Young and Lively.\nOh, the towering feeling\nJust to know somehow you are near\nI have often walked on this street before\nBut the pavement always stayed beneath my feet before\nAll at once am I several stories high\nKnowing I'm on the street where you live\nAre there lilac trees in the heart of town\nCan you hear a lark in any other part of town\nDoes enchantment pour out of every door\nNo, it's just on the street where you live\nFor oh, the towering feeling\nJust to know somehow you are near\nThe overpowering feeling\nThat any second you may suddenly appear\nPeople stop and stare, they don't bother me\nFor there's nowhere else on earth\nThat I would rather be\nLet the time go by, I won't care if I\nCan be here on the street where you live\nSound recording administered by SME (thanks for allowing this to remain)\n\"The AUDIO content does not belong to me.

{"input": "Answer these questions:\nStagecoach  Reviews & Ratings - IMDb\nIMDb\n22 December 2016 8:51 AM, PST\nNEWS\n101 out of 122 people found the following review useful:\nA great western which enables multiple interpretations\nfrom New York City\n30 April 2005\nJohn Wayne is \"The Ringo Kid\" in this John Ford-directed parable of outcasts traveling towards various kinds of figurative and literal redemption/salvation. On a surface level, the basic plot is disarmingly simple--a motley crew of eight takes a stagecoach from Tonto to Lordsburg, trying to avoid Geronimo and his Apaches on the way. They are having their own problems with the U.S. government and are thus likely to attack. The stagecoach bounces from outpost to outpost while the relationships of its passengers evolve, helping each other to \"find themselves\" and (usually) providing hope of some kind of new life.\nThe Ringo Kid has been wrongly accused of a crime and is on his way to Lordsburg to avenge both the false accusations and more importantly, the murder of his father and brother. Dallas (Claire Trevor) is implied to be a prostitute, and so is ostracized from Tonto (which means \"stupid\", \"foolish\" or \"daft\" in Spanish) by a self-stylized matronly moral majority. Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell) is far more concerned with getting drunk than being a doctor, and is partially ostracizing himself from Tonto. Hatfield (John Carradine) is a \"gambler gentleman\" with a shady reputation and a false identity. Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) is trying to get to her husband, who is in the military; she's in a surprisingly \"secret\" physical state. Samuel Peacock, whom everyone keeps mistaking for a reverend, is in the alcohol business and just wants to get back east to get back to his business. Henry Gatewood is a crooked banker trying to flee before his questionable dealings are discovered. And the stagecoach drivers consist of a lovable buffoon, Buck (Andy Devine) and the most forthright, straight arrow of the bunch, Marshal Curly Wilcox (George Bancroft).\nEven though Stagecoach remains tightly focused on its wilderness road trip, that might seem like a large stable of characters to shape into a taut plot. Ford, working from script by Dudley Nichols and Ben Hecht, based on a short story, \"Stage to Lordsburg\", by Ernest Haycox (which itself bears a relation to Guy de Maupassant's \"Boule de Suif\", 1880), keeps the proceedings in check by only giving us the information we need to explore the evolving relationships, and only focusing on each character when they're important to the plot. This results in a few of the characters being functionally absent for extended lengths of time, but Ford can so easily establish a \"deep\" character with a minimum of screen time that the absences are not a detriment.\nThe principal focus, of course, is between Ringo and Dallas, as on a significant level, Stagecoach becomes a romance. They're initially brought together via their mutual ostracization, even among the ostracized, which gives them an immediate bond beyond their physical attraction towards one another. Wayne and Trevor are both fantastic in their roles, avoiding the occasional overacting by some other performers. But this is a film where it's difficult to count the slight overacting as a flaw, as it was more of a stylistic tendency of the genre during this period and it provides a nice counterbalance to Wayne and Trevor.\nStagecoach is also famous for its setting. Much of the film was shot in Utah's Monument Valley, along authentic stagecoach \"roads\". The (beautiful) starkness of the desert is often taken as a symbolic trip through a kind of purgatory for the characters, where they're left alone with their souls, their only connection being their small group, to contemplate their pasts and futures. Whether we choose to read something along those lines into the film or not, Monument Valley is at least a captivating presence in the film, although for me, the cinematography could have been better technically, especially considering that Stagecoach was made at the same time as The Wizard of Oz (1939). Ford's famous tendency to do only one take results in a couple minor gaffes, such as the initial shot of John Wayne--a zoom into a close-up--that is out of focus for most of the zoom.\nAs one could guess, eventually our passengers run into a band of Apaches, who are often interpreted as representing more of a \"natural force\" that our heroes must surmount. The climax features a fabulous extended chase/fight sequence with a number of amazing stunts by both humans and animals. The most impressive human stunts are performed by the legendary Yakima Canutt, including one that involved being dragged through the dirt by the horse-pulled stagecoach, which was moving along at about 40 miles per hour and supposedly missed running over Canutt by only 12 inches (30.5 cm). This scene was an inspiration for a similar stunt in Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).\nAlthough it's not a \"perfect\" film to me, and it's not even my favorite western (I'm more partial to the classic spaghetti westerns, for example), Stagecoach is a very good film and was very influential, despite being made at a time when Ford was told that he was committing professional suicide by even contemplating a western. As the plethora of critical literature attests, it works on many levels, including as an allegorical microcosm of U.S. Depression-era society, and should be seen at least once by anyone serious about film literacy.\nWas the above review useful to you?\n72 out of 93 people found the following review useful:\nThe classic film that started it all.\nfrom The Beach\n20 September 2003\nThe Overland Stage Lines stagecoach is traveling from the frontier town of Tonto, Arizona to Lordsburg, New Mexico.  Geronimo, the Apache chief, has just jumped the reservation and starts an uprising.  Before leaving Tonto, the passengers are notified by the Calvary that they are now traveling at their own considerable risk but they will be escorted by the soldiers (here's a clue: don't believe it).  Among the passengers are a prostitute being thrown out of town by a group of women with their noses so stuck up in the air you could fly flags off of them.  She is joined by a drunken doctor, a gentlemen card shark, a meek whiskey salesman, a crooked banker, a pregnant woman on her way to meet her husband, and a young cowboy who just broke out of jail and out to revenge his family's murder.  The coach driver and his shotgun complete the group.\nIt's all based on a short story called appropriately Stage to Lordsburg but also on a French story (Guy de Maupassant's Boule de Suif) with similar characters traveling in a coach during the Franco-Prussian War.\nThe basic structure of the plot is also familiar to fans of disaster films.  Passengers are introduced, board a common conveyance and face a tremendous danger.  The exciting adventure of who lives, who dies, will the stage make it to its destination, and what happens next is highlighted by perhaps the most famous stunts in film history by the most famous and respected stuntman of all Yakima Canutt.  If one of the stunts looks familiar, Steven Speilberg recreated it for his first Indiana Jones film.\nThe film is also a lot more.  Unlike other westerns up to its time which were mainly shoot-em-ups between the good guys in the white hats and the bad guys in the black hats, it examines very serious social issues and how different people look down at others differently.  Besides prejudice, some of the characters are flawed with alcoholism, greed and revenge.  We also see the good in bad people with respect for new life and ultimately redemption.   Nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Interior Decoration, Best Film Editing, Best Supporting Actor (won) and Best Score (won), Stagecoach was John Ford's first sound Western and elevated the genre in both critical praise and popularity.  The low camera angles in Monument Valley would become a John Ford trademark.  Despite doing 70 films, this is the one that made Wayne a star and it's easy to see why.  Many consider it his best performance; both subtle and clear he cares for the needs of the people around him and yearns for his own need for a home, a wife and a family.  It is considered one of the great films in cinemas greatest year, 1939.  Gone With the Wind, Goodbye Mr. Chips, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Wuthering Heights, Dark Victory, The Wizard of Oz, Of Mice and Men and Ninotchka were all nominated for best picture alongside Stagecoach that year.\nRegarding the political incorrectness of an Apache uprising, well, they happened.  If you just happened to be in a stagecoach in the middle of the southwest during an Apache uprising chances are you would be killed.  This story does not examine the reasons for the uprising only the effects on a group of travelers trying to travel through it.\nWas the above review useful to you?\n55 out of 67 people found the following review useful:\nGreat ensemble western\nfrom Prague, Kalamazoo\n6 May 2004\nI grew up watching the old, crotchety, gruff John Wayne, the iconic hero of the right wing,  and even though I'd seen some of his early films on television, I'd forgotten what a sexy and  compelling presence he had when a young man. It's easy to see while watching his  performance how this film made him a star. As great as Wayne is in this film, he doesn't  overshadow any of his fellow performers. Thomas Mitchell plays the drunken doctor thrown  out of town, a performance that earned him an Academy Award. Andy Devine is hilarious as  the complaining, squeaky voiced stagecoach driver. John Carradine is sleek and snake-like as  the gambler. Claire Trevor gives a heartbreaking turn as the good-hearted whore thrown out  of town by pious hypocrites. Donald Meek plays his name, a meek whiskey salesman  befriended by the whiskey-loving Doc. Each actor quickly and deftly sketches his character  so vividly that every performance is memorable.\nBut the real star of the show is John Ford, the director. To introduce and define nine  characters in the context of a fast-paced western is no easy task, and he accomplishes it in  masterly fashion. Much of the action takes place in the limited confines of a stagecoach, but  Ford takes advantage of the limits by staging brilliant and subtle bits between characters;  John Wayne casts sultry glances at Clare Trevor, who blossoms under his glance, the young  calvary wife's eyes glaze over as the banker pontificates, and Doc sneaks sips of whiskey  from the samples case while he solicitously keeps the wind from chilling the whiskey  salesman. When the action moves outside, he films the action in dynamic angles and stunts  that were the most daring of its time.\nIf you enjoy westerns and haven't seen this, you have a great night of film-watching ahead of  you. And if the last time you saw Stagecoach was some midnight years ago when you  wandered home for a bit of the late show before bedtime, watch it again and rediscover what  a great western it is\nWas the above review useful to you?\n62 out of 84 people found the following review useful:\nOver the rise, it's the Duke, Winchester in hand\nfrom Buffalo, New York\n5 September 2005\nOne of my favorite movie shots of all time comes in Stagecoach when the coach rounds a bend and you see a figure in the distance and has the camera zooms in closer you recognize it as John Wayne, saddle in one hand and winchester rifle in the other.\nCertainly the figure of John Wayne is familiar enough even to today's moviegoers as the man who put more people in theater seats than any other player. But back then in 1939 all he was known as was B picture cowboy who was a friend of John Ford, whom Ford happened to be giving a break to. He sure took advantage of it.\nWayne heads an ensemble group of players who are journeying from Tonto to Lordsburg by stagecoach. It is a dramatization of the western novel by Ernest Haycox and John Ford brilliantly cast his film.\nAnyone of them could have been Oscar material, but one player did win an Oscar, Thomas Mitchell as the alcoholic Doc Boone. 1939 was maybe the highpoint of Mitchell's career. Imagine being in three films nominated for Oscars, Stagecoach, Gone With the Wind, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. He could have been nominated for any one of them.\nOn top of the coach is driver Andy Devine and riding shotgun is Marshal George Bancroft. Devine is a befuddled dunce and a lot of reviewers usually pass him over in talking about the film. To be sure he is, but there is a scene where the stagecoach has to cross a deep stream. A pontoon like device is rigged, but it's professional teamster Andy Devine who drives the stage across with his team swimming it. He may be a dunce, but he's a professional at his job. I think it was Andy's moment to shine.\nBancroft is a stern but kindly marshal. He and Mitchell are friends of Wayne who plays the Ringo Kid. Wayne's busted out the penitentiary to get the Plummer brothers who framed him. There's a reward for Wayne, but Marshal Bancroft ain't worried about the reward, he's concerned about Wayne getting killed, biting off more than he can chew.\nHowever Mitchell spends most of the journey cultivating mild mannered Donald Meek who's a whiskey salesman. A useful friend to have you like to imbibe. If ever a character actor was aptly named it certainly had to be Donald Meek.\nIn 1939 you couldn't say that Claire Trevor was playing a prostitute named Dallas. But it's surely hinted at often enough. Claire Trevor was Hollywood's greatest portrayer of girls with easy virtue and a heart of gold which she has here. She got her Oscar in Key Largo again playing just such a role. The difference is she loves good guy John Wayne instead bad guy Edward G. Robinson in Key Largo.\nAnd to add to the mix we have an embezzling banker on the journey played by Berton Churchill who played many a sanctimonious hypocrite in his career. He gets news that the telegraph is down because of the Apaches on the warpath and in an act of impulse fills a satchel full of the bank's money and grabs the stagecoach at the last minute. He's also trying to escape a hatchet faced harridan of a wife. Nevertheless he's the least sympathetic and most useless character on the journey.\nA few months ago I saw and reviewed the film Carrie which was based on a Theodore Dreiser novel. The lead character in that, George Hurstwood is also an embezzler of his employer's money as he runs away to New York to get away from his harridan of a wife. But Hurstwood, same crime for the same reasons, is a sympathetic figure. Not our friend banker Gatewood as Churchill portrays him here. It some times depends on the writer's point of view.\nThe last two passengers are John Carradine a mysterious gambler of Southern origins and the pregnant wife of an Army Captain played by stage actress Louise Platt. He also boards the stage at the last minute as he's crushing out big time over her. He becomes her protector during the journey.\nOf course Stagecoach is the first film that John Ford shot in Monument Valley and the long shots of the valley with the lonely stagecoach driving on to Lordsburg are breathtaking.\nAnd there's the Indian attack. The question is often asked why didn't the Indians just shoot the horses. The real answer is you wouldn't want to cut short abruptly one of the most spectacular chase scenes in film history. And then of course maybe the Indians wanted the live horses.\nFord uses for the first time a spectacular gambit during the Indian attack. I won't say more, but think about the fact that he repeated the same shot in Fort Apache with the Indians chasing John Agar and the repair party there.\nWhat I like most about Stagecoach altogether is that it sticks to the first rule of movies, it moves. Even in the scenes of dialog inside the coach you get the feeling of movement. Nothing static about it, and the story could never be adequately done on a stage.\nIt's what movie making is all about.\nWas the above review useful to you?\n41 out of 55 people found the following review useful:\nNot just a great western but one of the best movies ever made.\nfrom Costa Mesa CA\n4 March 2002\nStagecoach has all the hallmarks of a truly great film.The characters,the direction, the camera work, the scenery, the soundtrack. The story may seem simple but the characters are skillfully developed and colorful. They are real and interesting, not cliches. The desert setting and the stagecoach itself serve to make the great directing and camera work even greater. So many classic scenes in one movie. There are lot of little things like the shot of the coyote howling in the desert night. The shot of the stagecoach from behind going through a sand wash. The shot of the Indians on the hill looking down at the stagecoach. They look real and they look serious. The shot of the \"Ringo Kid\" watching Mr. Hatfield die.The \"Kid\" does'nt say a word but you can tell he's thinking about his murdered brother. The very first shot of John Wayne in his very first \"A\" movie may be his most memorable. Even if you've never seen Stagecoach you have seen that scene of the \"Ringo Kid\" holding his rifle and saddle while waving down the stage with the Monument Valley as a backdrop. No actor ever had a more spectacular debut. When you here the soundtrack, you can't help thinking about the Old West. John Ford should have won the Oscar for best director. His attention to details make this movie a classic. Classic in the sense that Stagecoach does'nt seem manufactured but seems like something that always was.\nWas the above review useful to you?\n39 out of 52 people found the following review useful:\nGrandeur of Monument Valley, Utah, became part of the signature on a John Ford Western...\n15 September 2002\n*** This review may contain spoilers ***\nThe remarkable thing about Ford's Westerns is his gift for simultaneously contemplating people as individuals and as representatives of virtues, vices, and other abstract qualities\n\"Stagecoach\" is the Western to combine successfully the poetic grandeur and sense of myth-making of the real and imagery West with pure entertainment values It is the Western in which the public first saw Monument Valley, Utah on film  a place that Ford would revisit again and again, and that became his favorite location for the exterior sequences of his Westerns It is the first Western to combine successfully the poetic grandeur and sense of myth-making of the real and imaginary West with pure entertainment values... It is so rich it has become a treasury of Western characters and motifs Prior to 'Stagecoach,' the western was in grievous decline, but with 'Stagecoach' a renaissance occurred...\n\"Stagecoach\" makes much capital out of an early means of communication Ford used it as a symbol  there is nothing more striking, as an image of loneliness, than a long-shot of a coach twisting its way through the arid and dry South-Western landscape  but also as a box for shaking and mixing human drama The combination is devastating Despite some complaining criticism that there is just a little too much contrivance about the selection of passengers riding in the 'box', that they look as if they've been handpicked for contrast and for drama, \"Stagecoach\" always repays another look It still works admirably Time takes little away from it\nEverything seems to fit in \"Stagecoach\" from the first moment that the camera races in on the imposing figure of John Wayne, a man of heroic size with a powerful stance, twirling his Winchester rifle in one hand to the gallery of colorful portraits in a shaking box to the dramatic black and white photography taking advantage of every trick of light and shade including cloudscapes and silhouettes\nFord carefully selected 'characters' boxed in for a troublesome ride They are not characters, save perhaps for the drunken doctor, in the usual Ford sense of beloved eccentrics They are highly contrasted 'types' who, by some alchemy that the movie develops, do grow to some extent into credible human beings\nApart from the drunken Doc (superb1y played by Thomas Mitchell), there's the mysterious southern gambler (John Carradine), a pregnant wife (Louise Platt) joining her soldier husband, a Whisky salesman (Donald Meek) who could kid anyone at first sightespecially an audiencethat he's a parson, a whore with a heart of gold (Claire Trevor), and an absconding banker (Barton Churchill). Andy Devine is in the driving seat, George Bancroft, as a U.S. Marshal, rides shot-gun and keeps a wary though fatherly eye on the Ringo Kid (john Wayne) who has come along for at least part of the ride...\nTwo things are at once apparent Ford is employing a dramatic device for which there is plenty of precedentcompressing diverse characters into a confined and highly charged situation in the certainty of reactions, and, secondly, that the Claire Trevor character is the spitting image, as they say, of Maupassant's tart, Boule de Suife\nGeronimo will be the catalyst for this load of combustibles He's on the loose again and the escorting cavalry have already had to say their farewells to the coach party\nAlong the way you will also see: The birth of a child, the telegraph lines cut, an attack by Indians, a chase, a cavalry rescue, a poker game, a three-against-one gunfight on the streets of a town, and an exciting climax\n\"Stagecoach\" leaves a whole host of abiding impressions There is the dramatic black and white photography taking advantage of every trick of light and shade in the wonderful Monument Valley location It was the first time that Ford had used this setting within the Navajo Indian reservation around and about the Arizona-Utah state dividing line The eroded lunar landscape has its own beauty and its own menace and these two qualities are reflected in the film Cloudscapes and silhouettesthese linger on.\n\"Stagecoach\" bulged with all the required ingredients of the classic Western It carried a full complement of the historic-pioneering elements and it also made room for that other constituent, the domestic law and order issue\nWas the above review useful to you?\n37 out of 50 people found the following review useful:\nStagecoach, a great movie, a great western.\nfrom Lincoln, England\n26 March 2002\nI first saw Stagecoach the year it was released 1939, when I was nine years old. I saw it again the other afternoon as a rerun on tv.  Despite that technically it is showing it's age, afterall it is 63 years old, and all of it's players are no longer with us, it is still one of the greatest westerns to ever grace a cinema screen. The indian attack, the cavalry to the rescue, the drunken doctor, the bar room floozie with a heart of gold, the gambler, and the hero doing \"what a man's got to do\" and escaping without a scratch .  All the ingredients and more of a classic western but done superbly. Not a scene overplayed, not a (film) shot wasted.\nWas the above review useful to you?\n31 out of 42 people found the following review useful:\nOne of the greatest westerns of all time.\nfrom Brea, Ca. USA\n18 December 1998\nStagecoach is not your normal, run of the mill, western. It will have you on the edge of your seat as passengers make their way through some dangerous Indian country. By the time the film ends, you will know all of the characters very well and ,for the most part,care whether they live or die.John Ford's excellent directing, great performances from John Wayne, Claire Trevor, Andy Devine and, especially, Thomas Mitchell who won an Acadamy Award for his portrayal of a drunken doctor aboard the stage. Add a great score, super stunt work, and filming done at Monument Valley (Arizona /Utah border) and you have a complete motion picture. I highly recommend \"Stagecoach\".\nWas the above review useful to you?\n25 out of 32 people found the following review useful:\nA Western with a timeless appeal; one of the few essential Ford/Wayne collaborations\nfrom United States\n15 July 2000\nThis film is not exactly a matured western, as it does show and (may or may not) endorse the conventional slaying of the battling natives by gunfire and such. But it shows how much a western can change in time, yet still have an appeal with its story elements, character, and especially with its style. An American classic nevertheless with director John Ford bringing his valley in Arizona which he would later use with star John Wayne in The Searchers and She wore a Yellow Ribbon, among others for himself as director, to the film of the tale of a group of people all stuck together on a stagecoach. After reading the short story from which the film is based on, some of the characters made sense, but they are still very much casted perfectly. New star John Wayne is in one these kinds of iconic performances that only got as good as with the Searchers. Plus there is Oscar winner Thomas Mitchell as a drunken, but not stupid, doctor. Very memorable as character study and as a pure action Western as well. As far as the style goes, the long-touted rumor that Orson Welles watched this film 40 times before directing Citizen Kane only makes the experience more enjoyable.\nWas the above review useful to you?\n29 out of 40 people found the following review useful:\nSetting the Stage.\nfrom United States\n30 April 2004\n\"Grand Hotel\"-styled Western that puts nine very different people together on the titled vehicle to go across some very dangerous Indian territory. There is convict John Wayne (in his star-making role), scorned prostitute Claire Trevor, drunken doctor Thomas Mitchell (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning role), slick gambler John Carradine, pregnant youngster Louise Platt, shady banker Berton Churchill, whiskey salesman Donald Meek, lawman George Bancroft and driver Andy Devine on this star-studded ride. Soon the characters are turned from would-be stereotypes to very complicated three-dimensional figures that are all deep and humanistic. \"Stagecoach\" does not only benefit from its actors and screenplay though as legendary director John Ford (Oscar-nominated) shows his ability to mix and mesh quiet, heartfelt moments with amazingly detailed action sequences that were way ahead of their time. A great picture from arguably the cinema's finest single year of films. 5 stars out of 5.\nWas the above review useful to you?\nPage 1 of 36:\nAnswer these questions:\nQ:Who directed the classic 30s western Stagecoach?\nA:", "references": [""], "dataset": "TriviaQA", "prompt_name": "self_construct", "id": "tc_280--29/29_8040.txt", "predictions": ["The film is a classic western that is a must-"]}

In reality their association was much more casual in nature stemming from their mutual patronage of Beaver Smith's saloon in Fort Sumner where they were both avid players of the card game Casino. They had a cordial acquaintance with one another but were never close friends nor did they ever ride together as outlaws.

(ASCAP)\nCourtesy of PolyGram Records, Inc.\n(Culver City, California) – See all my reviews\nYOUNG GUNS 2 was a stunning achievement, a sequel that managed to surpass its brilliant predecessor, 1988's YOUNG GUNS.  YOUNG GUNS 2 follows the story of Billy the Kid, already an outlaw and now riding with the cow thief Pat Garrett.  Garrett is offered the position of Sheriff by the Governor, who finds himself constantly cowed in his efforts to catch Billy the Kid.  In the Governor's mind, you must hire a thief to catch one, hence Garrett is the perfect choice.  Pat Garrett, who has long planned to go respectable, siezes the opportunity and turns on his friend and partner.  What follows is a great western adventure, rich with themes of sin and redemption and the tragedy of brother against brother.  That alone makes a great flick.  But then YOUNG GUNS 2 offers the question... what if Pat Garrett was conflicted about his choice?  What if he still had feelings for the Kid?  What if he let him go?  This is good stuff, folks.  The leads do the material justice, with Estevez jumping back into the role of Billy like an old and comfortable suit that still fits perfectly.  William Petersen gives a nuanced performance as Pat Garrett, a man driven by both loyalty and selfishness.  Of course no review of this film should fail to herald the talents of Lou Diamond Phillips.  Phillips is an actor who constantly seems to raise the bar for himself, and YOUNG GUNS 2 is no exception.  His Chavez is MORE spiritual, MORE effortlessly wise... dare I say MORE Indian than he was even in the first installment.  Hopefully, Phillips will be with us for a very long time.  Kiefer Sutherland, Christian Slater, Balthazar Getty, and Alan Ruck round out the talented cast.  So finally, do yourself a favor with this one, YOUNG GUNS 2 is an amazing film experience.\n27 of 32 people found this review helpful.  Was this review helpful to you?\nYes\nAnswer these questions:\nQ:Who was born first, Kiefer Sutherland or Christian Slater?\nA:", "references": [""], "dataset": "TriviaQA", "prompt_name": "self_construct", "id": "tc_1007--58/58_28888.txt", "predictions": [" The soundtrack is also a highlight, with Bon J"]}

For a moment, he thought he heard a woman's name being blown in the wind— Ten years later, James changed his name to Jimi Hendrix and formed the band, The Experience. When they debuted at the Monterey Pop Festival in 1967, Hendrix set his guitar on fire and began a new chapter in the history of rock. He died three years later of an accidental drug overdose.\n \nExcerpt: 'Jimi: Sounds Like A Rainbow'\nThe guitarist's story is know to many adult fans. But now, the story of young Jimi Hendrix's is now told in a new children's book by author Gary Golio and illustrator Javaka Steptoe, called \"Jimi Sounds Like a Rainbow: A Story of the Young Jimi Hendrix.\"\nIn addition to writing children's books Gary Golio is a children's therapist. As he tells Weekend Edition Saturday Host Liane Hansen, he feels that telling Hendrix's story to children helps them find their own path.\n\"Many of the kids I see if I say to them, what do you want to be when you grow up? Alot of them say 'I don't know',\" he says. \"If you don't have a goal as a young person, you're really adrift. Jimi had nothing materially, he was quite poor, but in his imagination, inside of himself, he lived a very rich inner life.\nGolio says that there are many important lessons to be learned from the young Jimi Hendrix.\n\"If you pass through the mythology about him, his childhood reflects all the values that we want to teach our children about. Persistence, and loving what you do, and having goals, positive goals, and investing yourself.

Are they just too expensive now? I know a lot of the great stars are no longer with us, but there are enough to make another gem like this one.  I just wish this movie was longer, so I could relish the performances of these brilliant people even more.  What a magic moment it is when LAUREN BACALL and INGRID BERGMAN clink champagne classes - you can almost hear \"As Time Goes By\" playing in the background. Come on Hollywood, give us another all star movie, before we lose even more Hollywood royalty!\nsource\nA Cast To Die For8/10\nThat Sidney Lumet knows how to frame an actor within his or her character is a very well known fact - \"The Pawnbroker\" \"Network\" \"Dog Day Afternoon\" and some other spectacular pieces of acting prove that point unquestionably. Here, there is a sort of \"divertissment\". Agatha Christie given a first class treatment (not that Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple wasn't first class, but the production value here is as impressive as the cast) in the hands of Sidney Lumet who knew how to put a bunch of sensational actors in a confined space - \"12 Angry Men\" for instance and make it riveting. There a 12 Angry people here too and (almost) each part is cast with relish and delight. Albert Finney, marvelous, manages, not only to survive, under the weight of his characterization but to create something bold, exquisitely structured, great fun to watch and to hear. Ingrid Bergman won her third Oscar for her missionary looking after little brown babies - I thought she was a highlight indeed but in my modest opinion, Valentina Cortese for \"Day For Night\" deserved it that year, Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates's twin brother, also with a mother fixation and a compelling facial tic. Wendy Hiller was, clearly, having a ball and that, on the screen, is always contagious. Sean Connery and Vanessa Redgrave make a surprisingly hot pair, Lauren Bacall over does it of course but who cares, Jacqueline Bisset is breathtaking, Rachel Roberts a hoot. John Gielgud is John Gielgud and that in itself is a major plus. Colin Blakely does wonders with his moment and Dennis Quilley plays his Italian as if this was a silent movie. Martin Balsam is always fun to watch, no matter the accent. Richard Widmark is splendid in his villainy and Jean Pierre Cassel very moving indeed. The only weak spot in the cast is Michael York. Totally unbelievable. I suspect that \"Murder in The Orient Express\" 33 years old already, will continue delighting audiences for years to come.\nsource\nExcellent Agatha Christie murder mystery9/10\nI love murder mysteries. I'm a sucker for them whether it's reading a book or seeing a movie. \"Murder on the Orient Express\" is one of the best murder mystery movies ever made. Based on the novel by mystery sleuth Agatha Christie, it takes you on a ride by train where we meet an assortment of colorful characters all traveling on the Orient Express. When one of these characters is murdered, the rest become suspects. And it's up to famed Belgian detective Hercule Poirot to solve the crime. \"Murder on the Orient Express\" has an intriguing script, good direction, and a spectacular cast to boot. Albert Finney is picture perfect in his Oscar nominated portrayl of the fussy Poirot. While watching Finney in this movie, I can't believe that this is the same man who played Julia Roberts' boss in \"Erin Brockovich\" because he's so unrecognizable here. Finney is supported by an all-star cast of mostly familiar faces. Of the actors playing the suspects, Lauren Bacall scores highest as an annoying American woman who talks loud and isn't afraid to say what's on her mind. Also good: the great Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman who won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar (her third overall) for her small performance as an African missionary; and Martin Balsam as the director of the line and Mr. Poirot's personal friend. Jacqueline Bisset, Jean-Pierre Cassel, Sean Connery, John Gielgud, Wendy Hiller, Anthony Perkins, Vanessa Redgrave, Rachel Roberts, Richard Widmark, and Michael York round out the familiar cast. \"Murder on the Orient Express\" is a classy movie to be sure. Is this the best murder mystery movie ever made? Almost. A few years later came the next Agatha Christie movie \"Death on the Nile\", which in my opinion topped \"Murder on the Orient Express\" and ranks as my all-time favorite mystery movie. But \"Murder on the Orient Express\" places right behind \"Death on the Nile\" as the second best. There is no question that these two movies would be perfect to show on television as a double feature. Stick 'em on AMC, and your all set.\n***1/2 (out of four)\nsource\nIt Oozes Elegance10/10\nThis whodunit story by Dame Agatha is excellent. She has always been my favorite writer of detective fiction. I keep returning to the film version, however, not because of the story but because of the film's sheer elegance and style. It is awash in elegance ... the majestic cinematography; the glamorous clothes; the delightfully eccentric aristocratic characters; the mysterious yet refined musical score. The film is so theatrically regal I'm surprised that it did not feature a representative of British royalty.\nThe setting is Europe in the 1930's. The pace is slow and relaxed. And while the dialogue is in English, the film has a deliciously international flavor, with a mix of interesting accents and word pronunciations. Heavy on dialogue, the film never seems overly talky, the result of a clever screenplay and lush visuals. Humor is included in the script usually in the form of tasteful put-downs. Example: an attractive Mrs. Hubbard comments: \"Don't you agree the man must have entered my compartment to gain access to Mr. Ratchett?\" The aging Princess Dragomiroff responds in a deadpan tone: \"I can think of no other reason, madam.\"\nIn his portrayal of Hercule Poirot, Albert Finney almost literally disappears into the role, a tribute to convincing makeup and to Finney's adroit acting. His performance is appropriately idiosyncratic, deliciously hammy, and theatrical, every bit as entertaining in this film as Peter Ustinov is in subsequent Christie movies. The rest of the cast has ensemble parts, my favorite being Wendy Hiller whose Princess Dragomiroff comes across as royal, proud, and very eccentric.\nWith its snowy landscapes, ornate and cozy interiors, and subdued lighting, \"Murder On The Orient Express\" is an excellent movie to watch on a cold, winter night, snuggled under a blanket or next to a warm fireplace with a cup of cappuccino or a glass of cognac. Just be sure that all knives and daggers in your mansion are out of reach from your staff of servants.\nWhen  Agatha Christie Finally Came Into Her Own Cinematically9/10\nAgatha Christie lived long enough to enjoy something few of her contemporaries could claim.\nMovies based on Christie's novels and stories were being made back to the 1930s. One early one with Charles Laughton as Hercule Poiret so turned her off that she was hesitant about future productions of her work. But they were made - like the two versions of LOVE FROM A STRANGER. There were two high points: Rene Clair's AND THEN THERE WERE NONE and Billy Wilder's WITNESS FOR THE PROSECUTION (oddly enough with Laughton again, but in a better fitting performance). Then came the popular series of Miss Marple films with Margaret Rutherford, which were rewritten to emphasize Rutherford's comic abilities (and to give Miss Marple a companion - Mr. Stringer, played by Rutherford's husband Stringer Davis). Another attempt at Poirot was made, again as a comic film, THE A.B.C.MURDERS (with Tony Randall as Poirot). Christie was not amused. But in 1974 she saw her vision of Hercule Poirot as a character put properly on screen by Albert Finney in MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS.\nIt gave her a satisfaction that few mystery novelists of her age ever had. Dorothy Sayers did live to see Lord Peter Wimsey played by Robert Montgomery in BUSMAN'S HONEYMOON, but while entertaining it was not the Wimsey that she created - she died before she could see Ian Carmichael play the role on a series of television multi-episodes shows based on her novels. While Josephine Tey's novels occasionally were made into films, her Inspector Grant was not turned into a good running series character.\nI think that the reason that Agatha Christie was satisfied was the care that Sidney Lumet took with MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS. Not only the all star cast involved, but keeping the story in the late 1920s to early 1930s style, with clothing, vehicles, and class snobbery maintained. It actually helped preserve the novel's effectiveness.\nThe casting is quite good. Poirot is ably played by Finney, who is fussy but also serious and sharp when going over the clues and interrogations. Martin Balsam as his friend, the railroad official, is properly \"watsonish\", constantly jumping at conclusions as to who the killer is. Interestingly forgotten in the background is the only other passenger we learn of that is not under suspicion, the Greek doctor who assists Poirot (George Coulouris). In the 1940s Coulouris would have been a red herring at least.\nThe suspects (led by Lauren Bacall and Wendy Hiller) are properly snobbish (especially Sean Connery). They are even snobbish towards each other. But the question of who killed the victim is handled to constantly throw off the viewers. It is one of the most perfectly balanced whodunits.\nI only have one minor criticism. The murder centers on a \"Lindbergh\" kidnap-murder tragedy of the past, and the killer has to be someone after the real brains behind the tragedy. So all the suspects happen to be connected to the victim(s). But as it turns out there was one victim who was overlooked - the patsy killer (based on Hauptmann?) who was frightened into committing the crime and was hanged. It would have been interesting if the family of this criminal also had been represented among the suspects.\nAnswer these questions:\nQ:Which Swedish actress won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for Murder on the Orient Express?\nA:", "references": [""], "dataset": "TriviaQA", "prompt_name": "self_construct", "id": "tc_1156--101/101_33638.txt", "predictions": ["The film is a classic.

{"input": "Answer these questions:\nBaltimore Oriole, Life History, All About Birds - Cornell Lab of Ornithology\nAbout the size of a Red-winged Blackbird, but slimmer.\nOther Names\nBosero de Baltimore (Spanish)\nCool Facts\nBaltimore Orioles got their name from their bold orange-and-black plumage: they sport the same colors as the heraldic crest of England’s Baltimore family (who also gave their name to Maryland’s largest city).\nUnlike robins and many other fruit-eating birds, Baltimore Orioles seem to prefer only ripe, dark-colored fruit. Orioles seek out the darkest mulberries, the reddest cherries, and the deepest-purple grapes, and will ignore green grapes and yellow cherries even if they are ripe.\nThe Baltimore Oriole hybridizes extensively with the Bullock's Oriole where their ranges overlap in the Great Plains. The two species were considered the same for a while and called the Northern Oriole, but in the 1990s, after genetic studies, they were separated again.\nYoung male Baltimore Orioles do not molt into bright-orange adult plumage until the fall of their second year. Still, a few first-year males in drab, female-like plumage succeed in attracting a mate and raising young. Females become deeper orange with every molt; some older females are almost as bright orange as males.\nBaltimore Orioles sometimes use their slender beaks to feed in an unusual way, called “gaping”: they stab the closed bill into soft fruits, then open their mouths to cut a juicy swath from which they drink with their brushy-tipped tongues.\nThe orioles of the Americas were named after similar-looking birds in the Old World, but the two groups are not closely related. Orioles of the Old World are in the family Oriolidae, whereas American orioles are in the same family as blackbirds and meadowlarks. Both New and Old World orioles are brightly colored with red, yellow, and black; have long tails and long pointed bills; build hanging, woven nests; and prefer tall trees around open areas.\nThe oldest recorded Baltimore Oriole was over 12 years old when it was caught and killed by a raptor in Minnesota.\nHabitat\nOpen Woodland\nOn their breeding grounds in eastern and east-central North America, you’ll most often find Baltimore Orioles high in leafy deciduous trees, but not in deep forests; they prefer open woodland, forest edge, river banks, and small groves of trees. They also forage for insects and fruits in brush and shrubbery. Baltimore Orioles have adapted well to human settlement and often feed and nest in parks, orchards, and backyards. On their winter range in Central America, Baltimore Orioles occupy open woodlands, gardens, and shade-grown coffee and cacao plantations. They frequently visit flowering trees and vines in search of fruit and nectar.\nFood\nInsects\nBaltimore Orioles eat insects, fruit, and nectar. The proportion of each food varies by season: in summer, while breeding and feeding their young, much of the diet consists of insects, which are rich in the proteins needed for growth. In spring and fall, nectar and ripe fruits compose more of the diet; these sugary foods are readily converted into fat, which supplies energy for migration. Baltimore Orioles eat a wide variety of insects, including beetles, crickets, grasshoppers, moths, and flies, as well as spiders, snails, and other small invertebrates. They eat many pest species, including tent caterpillars, gypsy moth caterpillars, fall webworms, spiny elm caterpillars, and the larvae within plant galls. However, orioles can also damage fruit crops, including raspberries, mulberries, cherries, oranges and bananas, and some fruit growers consider these birds a pest.\nBehavior\nFoliage Gleaner\nBaltimore Orioles are agile feeders that comb the high branches of trees in search of insects, flowers and fruit. They are acrobatic foragers, clambering across twigs, hanging upside down, and fluttering to extend their reach. They also fly out from perches to snatch insects out of the air. Because they forage in the treetops, they are more often seen than heard, but males often sing from conspicuous posts at the tops of trees, where their blazing orange breast attracts the eye. Both males and females may be glimpsed fluttering among the leaves, and come readily to bird feeders supplied with fruit or nectar. Many other birds defend large feeding territories, but orioles defend only the space near their nests, and so you may see several neighboring orioles feeding close to each other. When courting, the male displays by hopping around the female, bowing forward and spreading his wings to reveal his orange back. A receptive female responds by fanning her tail, lowering and fluttering her wings, and making a chattering call.\nstatus via IUCN\nLeast Concern\nBaltimore Oriole populations have been declining throughout their range with Canada experiencing over a 3 percent loss per year (resulting in a cumulative loss of 24 percent) between 1966 and 2010, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. Partners in Flight estimates the global breeding population at 12 million, with 82 percent spending part of the year in the U.S., 18 percent breeding in Canada, and 24 percent wintering in or migrating through Mexico. They rate a 10 out of 20 on the Continental Concern Score and are not on the 2012 Watch List. Because they breed in North America and winter in Central and South America, Baltimore Orioles are vulnerable to deforestation and habitat loss in many nations; their conservation requires international cooperation. Spraying insecticides onto trees not only kills off Baltimore Orioles’ insect food, but may poison the birds directly. Orioles and many other songbirds migrate at night, when they can become disoriented by lights or rainstorms and crash into tall structures such as skyscrapers and radio towers.\nBack to Top\nCredits\nRising, J.D., and N.J.

From early April to late May, flocks arrive in eastern and central North America to breed from Louisiana through central Canada. They start to leave as early as July for wintering grounds in Florida, the Caribbean, Central America, and the northern tip of South America.\nBackyard Tips\nBaltimore Orioles seek out ripe fruit. Cut oranges in half and hang them from trees to invite orioles into your yard. Special oriole feeders filled with sugar water supplement the flower nectar that Baltimore Orioles gather. You can even put out small amounts of jelly to attract these nectar-eaters (just don't put out so much that it risks soiling their feathers). Planting bright fruits and nectar-bearing flowers, such as raspberries, crab apples, and trumpet vines, can attract Baltimore Orioles year after year. Find out more about what this bird likes to eat and what feeder is best by using the Project FeederWatch Common Feeder Birds bird list .\nFind This Bird\nAim your eyes high when looking for Baltimore Orioles. They’re most often seen perched at the tops of trees or flitting through the upper foliage in search of insects. Listen for their distinctive chatter, which is unlike the call of any other bird where orioles occur.

{"input": "Answer these questions:\nThe Babe’s Last Game | Philadelphia Athletics\nPhiladelphia Athletics\nThe Babe’s Last Game\nBy Bob Warrington\nHollywood has twice portrayed the life of Babe Ruth in major motion pictures. The first, “The Babe Ruth Story,” done in 1948, starred William Bendix as the Bambino. Generally regarded as a terrible film with Bendix horribly miscast in the lead role, the film sugar coated Ruth’s life beyond recognition. Hollywood’s second effort at telling the Babe’s life was filmed in 1992. Called, “The Babe,” it starred John Goodman as the Sultan of the Swat and received more favorable reviews, with Leonard Maltin calling it “agreeably sentimental.” Maltin also notes, however, that “facts are tampered with and often ignored” in both films. That is certainly true in how they overlook reality in depicting Ruth’s last game as a Major Leaguer.\nA Last Hurrah\nIn 1935, Babe Ruth was forty years old, in poor physical shape, and playing out the string with the Boston Braves. On May 25, 1935, with the team on a road trip and playing at Forbes File in Pittsburgh, Ruth hammered three home runs and a single, driving in six runs. The last, off pitcher Guy Bush, was the 714th of Ruth’s career and the first ball ever to be hit completely over Forbes Field’s right-field roof (added to the ballpark in 1925). Thanks to Hollywood, many people believe that was Ruth’s final Major League game—circling the bases in triumph one last time before going into the dugout, entering the clubhouse, and calling it a career. The scene, undoubtedly, provides a storybook conclusion to a fabled tale. Wouldst that it was true; but regrettably, it is not. Maybe Ruth should have called it a career at that point, but perhaps sensing that the old magic was back, he hung around for one more game.\n \nFinal Stop\nAfter leaving Pittsburgh, the Braves next stop on their road trip was Philadelphia. There, they would play the Philadelphia Phillies at Baker Bowl. Like Babe Ruth, Baker Bowl’s days of glory had receded to the past. The ballpark, widely ridiculed for its deteriorating condition, was near the end of its life as the home of a Major League baseball team. The Phillies would finally abandon it mid-way through the 1938 season, moving down Lehigh Avenue to become tenants of the Philadelphia Athletics at Shibe Park. But, there was one more moment of drama to be played out at the old place, mixing both acclamation and pathos. Babe Ruth would provide it on May 30, 1935.\n \nThe Braves were scheduled to play the Phillies in a Memorial Day doubleheader. Ruth was inserted in the line-up, batting third and playing leftfield. Coming up to bat in the first inning, Ruth faced Phillies’ pitcher Jim Bivin. 1935 was Bivin’s only year in the Major Leagues, and he played the entire season with the Phillies. He compiled an unenviable 2-9 record for a woeful team that would finish the season in seventh place with a 56-93 record. Bivin, nevertheless, would have the singular distinction of being the last pitcher ever to face Babe Ruth in a Major League game.\n \nAt the plate, Ruth grounded out softly to Phillies first baseman Dolph Camilli as the Braves went down without scoring any runs in the inning. Ruth took his customary place in the outfield for the bottom half of the inning. Phillies’ second baseman Lou Chiozza hit a soft fly to leftfield. Ruth came in trying to make the catch, but the ball dropped in front of him and rolled past to the wall. A run scored, but Chiozza, trying for an inside-the-park home run, was thrown out at the plate when Braves shortstop Bill Urbanski retrieved the ball and got it back to Braves catcher Al Spohrer in time for the tag out. The Phillies wound up scoring three runs in the inning and would go on to win the game 11-6.\nRich Westcott, in his book, “Philadelphia’s Old Ballparks,” describes what happened after the first inning ended:\n \n“As the inning ended, Ruth tucked his glove in his pocket, turned, and ran to the clubhouse in centerfield. The fans, sensing that the end of a glorious career might have arrived, rose and gave Ruth a standing ovation.”\n \nOn June 2, 1935, Ruth was given his unconditional release by the Boston Braves, and he announced his retirement from baseball.\n \nAlthough it is not recorded in any contemporary histories of the game, one might wonder if Babe Ruth paused just briefly to take one last look around Baker Bowl before entering the clubhouse. You see, it was at this same ballpark 20 years before that Ruth had made his first appearance in a World Series game. Playing then for the Boston Red Sox, he appeared as a pinch hitter in the first game of the 1915 Series. In a similarity touched with irony, Ruth grounded out to the Phillies first baseman, just as he would do 20 years later in his last Major League at-bat in the same ballpark.\n \nThe Occasion Commemorated\nSo, despite Hollywood’s attempts to portray Ruth’s last Major League game in triumphal terms at Forbes Field, it was actually shrouded in pathos at Baker Bowl that the Babe’s fabled career came to an end. The Pennsylvania state historical marker erected for Baker Bowl, which was sponsored by the A’s Society and stands at Broad Street and Huntingdon Avenue, correctly notes that the ballpark was the site of “Babe Ruth’s last Major League game.”\n \nAnswer these questions:\nQ:For which team did Babe Ruth blast his last Major League home run?\nA:", "references": [""], "dataset": "TriviaQA", "prompt_name": "self_construct", "id": "tc_1542--93/93_45766.txt", "predictions": ["The Babe Ruth Memorial Park, located in the heart of"]}

But as this list of the Top 10 Blondie Songs prove, the band seemed oblivious to it all. Or, more accurately, they were well aware that they were crossing lines — they just didn’t care. Blondie came out of New York City’s punk scene, but they were more tuneful (and pop-minded) and less artsy than most of their contemporaries. From the early-’60s girl-group pop they embraced early on through the disco beats that made them stars to the groundbreaking New Wave/hip-hop fusion of “Rapture,” they rarely stayed in one place.
